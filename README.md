# Face-Detection using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript

## Overview
Face-Detection is a web application that utilizes CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to detect faces in images in real-time. The project leverages the power of machine learning and computer vision techniques to provide an intuitive and interactive user experience for face detection.

## Key Features
1. Face Detection: The project incorporates cutting-edge computer vision algorithms to identify and highlight faces within uploaded images. It uses JavaScript libraries like OpenCV.js or Face-API.js to perform accurate and real-time face detection.

2. Facial Expressions: With this project, users can gain insights into the emotions conveyed by the detected faces. By employing machine learning techniques, the application can analyze facial expressions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. It provides an intuitive graphical representation of these emotions, allowing users to understand the underlying sentiment.

3. Face Landmarks: The project goes beyond basic face detection by utilizing advanced techniques to identify specific facial landmarks. By employing sophisticated algorithms, it accurately detects facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows. Users can visualize these landmarks on the uploaded images, providing a detailed analysis of facial structure.

4. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Implementation: The project is implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly web application. HTML provides the structure, CSS enhances the visual appeal with custom styling, and JavaScript powers the underlying functionality, making the project interactive and dynamic.

5. User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can simply upload an image, and the application will instantly detect faces, extract facial expressions, and display the identified landmarks. The results are presented in a visually appealing manner, enhancing the overall user experience.

6. Extensible and Open Source: This project is open source, allowing developers to contribute, modify, or extend its functionalities as needed. The codebase is well-documented, making it easy for developers to understand and customize the project according to their requirements.
